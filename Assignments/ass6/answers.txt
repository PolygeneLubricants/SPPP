6.1.1)
Yes

6.1.2)
No

6.1.3)
Yes

6.1.4)
It would be safe to only use the tielock. But then we could only transfer money between
any two acounts at a time, thus no concurrency.

6.2.1)
It may deadlock because of the locking of the forks. E.g. all philosophers may take/lock the 
left fork and then no philosopher can take/lock the right fork.

6.2.2)
It never deadlocks on our machine.. in the time we gave it (30 minutes).
But, yes, the time it takes to deadlock will vary.

6.2.3)
We do not get a deadlock.

6.2.4)
Done, see code.

6.2.5)
Done, see code.

6.2.6)
We observe they get to eat equally often, approximately.

6.4.1)
ThreadSafe says zero potential problems.

6.4.2)
ThreadSafe says zero potential problems.

6.4.3)
ThreadSafe gives us "@GuardedBy annotation on field 'counts' violated"
this mean we are accessing the field counts of an instance without locking the object
which is guarding the field (The hist-instance in this case).
